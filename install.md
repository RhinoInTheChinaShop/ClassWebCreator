This file currently outlines how we plan to make the install process work in the future, later the contents will be changed to actually aid someone through the install process.  
The information about how install *will* work is mainly for ourselves, so we can remember for later, but have publicly included it for anyone interested.

The install process will require the latest version of the code to be uploaded to the server,
either by uploading a single file (`install_bootstrap.php`?) which will download the other files,
or just uploading the whole install script.  Uploading the whole install directory can be a pain with some
ftp clients, so the single file method can ease some of the problems.
